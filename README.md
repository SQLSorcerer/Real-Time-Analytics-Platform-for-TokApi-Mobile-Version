# Real-Time Analytics Platform for TokApi – Mobile Version

## Objective

The Real-Time Analytics Platform for TokApi – Mobile Version is designed to provide a robust and scalable solution for real-time analytics using cutting-edge AWS technologies. The primary objective is to leverage AWS services such as Kinesis Firehose, Lambda, and DynamoDB Streams to enable the seamless collection, processing, and storage of analytics data for the TokApi mobile application.

## Tech Stack

The technology stack for this project includes:

- **AWS Services:**
  - **Kinesis Firehose:** A fully managed service for delivering real-time streaming data to destinations such as Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, or Amazon Elasticsearch.
  - **Lambda:** A serverless computing service that runs code in response to events, allowing for the execution of functions without the need to provision or manage servers.
  - **DynamoDB Streams:** A feature of Amazon DynamoDB that captures a time-ordered sequence of item-level modifications in any DynamoDB table.

- **Programming Language:**
  - **Python:** Used for developing Lambda functions. Python's simplicity and versatility make it an ideal choice for serverless functions.

## Getting Started

To set up the Real-Time Analytics Platform for TokApi – Mobile Version, follow these steps:

1. **AWS Account:**
   - Ensure you have an AWS account with the necessary permissions to create and configure services.

2. **Configuration:**
   - Configure your AWS credentials and ensure the required IAM roles and policies are in place.

3. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the necessary AWS resources using the provided CloudFormation templates or through the AWS Management Console.

4. **Lambda Functions:**
   - Develop and deploy Python-based Lambda functions to process and analyze streaming data.

5. **Integration:**
   - Integrate the platform with the TokApi mobile application by utilizing the provided APIs and SDKs.

## Usage

Once the Real-Time Analytics Platform is set up, it will automatically handle the ingestion, processing, and storage of analytics data. Developers can leverage the insights generated by the platform to enhance the TokApi mobile application's performance and user experience.

## Maintenance and Troubleshooting

Regular maintenance may involve monitoring resource usage, updating configurations, and ensuring that the system scales appropriately with increasing data volumes. Troubleshooting can be facilitated through AWS CloudWatch logs and other monitoring tools.
